**Introduction**

The average salary of an NBA basketball player is 7.7 million dollars. with such a high salary range, many kids grow up and aspire to be a professional athlete. However, when I first heard of the aveage salary, I was shocked. I pondered as to how the average salary is 7.7 million when players such as James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Lebron James, and Draymond Green  are making over 25 million dollars. At first I believed it was just because they were superstars, but when looking at Draymond Green, who averaged 7.7 points per game last season, land a 100 million dollar contract with the Golden State Warriors, I started to wonder what is the best way a potential professional athlete should take in order to achieve financial success in the National Basketball Association.

My data was collect from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/meicher/201718-advanced-player-metrics-salary), a website named Kaggle. The Data set contains Salary and Statistics (advanced/basic) for NBA players during the 17-18 regular season. 

My overall plan with this data is to analyze the common ways professional athletes recieve contracts in the NBA. There are 4 main ways:

- Cap Space
  - A Salary Cap is the total amount of money NBA teams are allowed to use to pay its players. The salary cap for the 2017-18 season was set at $99.093 million. Jun 30, 2018. Thus, normally if a player recieved a contract due to Cap Space, then 
  
- Bird Rights
  - Players that signed using Bird rights, formally known as Bird Exception, allows teams to exceed the salary cap to sign their own free agents at an amount up to the maximum salary.
  
- Minimum Salary
 - The minimum salary is in place in order to protect all players (especially veterans, who are rewarded with higher values on their minimum deals depending on their years of service in the league), providing them with an absolute floor amount for what they will earn from teams interested in signing them.
 
- First Round pick
  - The four-year minimum base salaries for players in this year's draft are as follows: $480,000 (Year 1), $555,000 (Year 2), $630,000 (Year 3) and $705,000 (Year 4). After four years, players are allowing to sign maximum salaries.
  
  
  I have not seen any other analyses used in this data set. Thus, everything that I will do in this exploration will be blind. I am not using this dataset for any other class.


### Data wrangling: Cleaning up the 2017-2018 NBA Players Statistics.
<!--  
Very briefly discuss how you got the data into shape for your analyses. You can include some code here, although extensive data cleaning code should be put on github or in an appendix at the end of the document. 
--> 
  The original data set contained an NBA player's name, country, salary, draft number, position, age, and their respective statistics per game. I filtered my data set to only contain players from the United States. I also realized the the column with a player's salary was a string data type, so I had to use the as.numeric function to make it integers.

```{r }

USA_players <- filter(mydata, NBA_Country == "USA" )

USA_players <- mutate(USA_players,
                      SALARY = sub("\\$", "", Salary),
                      SALARY_change = sub("\\,", "", SALARY),
                      SALARY_final = sub("\\,", "", SALARY_change),
                      SALARY_numeric = as.numeric(SALARY_final),
                      log_Salary = log(SALARY_numeric, 10)
)
```

  I also noticed my data set has duplicated rows (which are the players). This is because throughout the season, many players were traded to other teams. To make the data more simplified I decided to remove any players that are duplicated or are missing any column statistics.

```{r}
USA_players <- USA_players[!duplicated(USA_players$Player), ] #Remove's Duplicates
USA_players <- USA_players[!(is.na(USA_players$Salary) | USA_players$Salary==""), ] #Removes ones without salary
USA_players <- USA_players[!(is.na(USA_players$Signed.Using) | USA_players$Signed.Using==""), ]
```

### Visualize the data: Change the subtitle here to describe what you are plotting etc.
<!--  
Create one or more plots of your data. Describe the plot(s), what they shows, and why they are of interest to your analysis. Include the code to create these plots in the R chunk below. You can also discuss the plots after the code too. Finally, be sure to make plots as clear as possible (clear axis labeling, legends and captions) so that it is easy for the reader to quickly understand the central information being conveyed. 
--> 

Using ggplot, I created a boxplot which shows the relationship between a player's salary and how they signed their contract (ie Cap Space, 1st round pick, minimum salary, bird rights). This is of interest to me because I want to show how the way a basketball player signs their contract can affect their salary.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
 USA_players_salaries_reason_to_sign <- USA_players[USA_players$Signed.Using %in% c("Cap Space", "1st Round Pick", "Minimum Salary", "Bird Rights"), ]
 
#boxplot(SALARY_numeric ~ Signed.Using, data = USA_players_salaries_reason_to_sign)

col = c("blue", "green", "red", "black")

ggplot(USA_players_salaries_reason_to_sign, aes(x = Signed.Using, y = log_Salary, )) +
  geom_boxplot(col = col) + ggtitle("Boxplot of the Way a Player Signed and Their Salary") + xlab("How a Player Signed") + ylab("Salary")

ggplot(USA_players_salaries_reason_to_sign, aes(Player, log_Salary, col = Signed.Using))+
  geom_point(apha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  xlab("Player") +
  ylab("Salary (With the Log Transformation)") +
theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
      axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
  
```
The visualization of the data shows that there there is difference in the range of salaries between how a player signed. It seems as though players who signed using "bird rights" have a longer range and median of salaries. Therefore I believe there is a difference of salaries. But to prove this I will run a hypothesis tests for more than two means.

### Analyses: Sub-title about the analyses/models you are using 

<!--  
Build linear models, run hypothesis tests, create confidence intervals and/or run simulations to answer questions that are of interest. 
--> 

**Hypothesis test for more than two means**

I am borrowing code that was used to get the MAD statistic from homework 5. My NULL, Alternative, and Significance Level are below:

**Null**: There is no difference in the mean salaries for each way to sign a contract.
    Mean(salary of 1st Round Picks) =  Mean(salary of Bird Rights players) =  Mean(salary of Cap Space players) =  Mean(salary of Minimum Salary players)

**Alternative**: At least 1 pair of the mean's ratings are different.

**In symbols**
$\mu_i = \mu_j$

NULL: $H_0: \mu_{ 1st Round Pick } = \mu_{Bird Rights} = \mu_{Cap Space} = \mu_{Minimum Salary}$
ALTERNATIVE: $H_A: \mu_{ 1st Round Pick } = \mu_{Bird Rights} = \mu_{Cap Space} = \mu_{Minimum Salary}$ must be false. At least one of these equatilites are not true.

**The significance level**

Significance level is $\alpha$ = 0.05. IF the signifiance level falls below this, I will REJECT the null hypothesis.

For this analyses, I use the MAD statistic to compare the mean Salaries between the different ways players signed.

```{r}
# store the Salary and How they signed in objects
player_salary <- USA_players_salaries_reason_to_sign$log_Salary
player_signing <- USA_players_salaries_reason_to_sign$Signed.Using

# get the mean salary for each way a player got signed
group_means <- get_group_means(player_salary, player_signing)
group_means

# Calculate the MAD statistic
obs_stat <- get_MAD_stat(group_means)
obs_stat
```


  |     How the player signed     | Mean Salary
  |-------------------------------|-----------| 
  | !st Round Pick                | 2910078   |
  | Bird Rights                   | 2909117   | 
  | Cap Space                     | 2911725   | 
  | Minimum Salary                | 2911725   | 
  
I will now create steps 2-5 of the hypothesis test. I will plot the null distribution along with a red vertical line at the real MAD statistic value. I will also report the p-value below. 

```{r}
null_dist <- NULL #Which will create the new MAD Statistics.

for(i in 1:10000){
  new_signings <- sample(player_signing)
  new_means <- get_group_means(player_salary, new_signings)
  null_dist[i] <- get_MAD_stat(new_means)
  }

# plot the null distribution with a red vertical line for the statistic value
hist(null_dist,
     nclass = 10,
     main = "NULL distribution using the MAD Statistic",
     xlab = "values",
     ylab = "frequency",
     xlim = c(0, .6))

abline(v = obs_stat, col = "red")
(p_value <- sum(null_dist>=obs_stat)/length(null_dist))
```

Based on this analysis comparing group means using the MAD statistic, there does appear to be a difference between between the player's salary depending on the way they signed. With a P-value of 0, I can reject the null hypothesis, which would make my Alternative Hypthesis (that there is a difference between the salaries of the way players signed) to be statistically significant.


But I also wanted to see if there any other predictors of a player's salary. I used backwards stepwise regression to do this. I fitted a linear model that shows the relationship between a player's salary and their other numeric respective statistics 

```{r}
lm_fit_original <- lm(log_Salary ~ NBA_DraftNumber +  Age + G + MP + PER + TS.
+X3PAr+ FTr+ ORB. + DRB. + TRB. +AST. +STL.+BLK.+TOV.+USG.+OWS +DWS +WS +OBPM +DBPM+BPM +VORP, data = USA_players)

summary(lm_fit_original)
```

The Descriptive Statistics above show that Age, Games, and Minutes Played were statistically significant predictors of a players salary. However, when using Backwards Stepwise regression, I would repeat this process again but remove any predictors that are not statistically significant one by one.

#Using Neyman PEarson Paradigm, I will take out TRB even though it has a P Value of 0.06

lm_fit <- lm(SALARY_numeric ~ NBA_DraftNumber +  Age + G + MP + TS.
              +WS +OBPM, data = USA_players)

#remove OBPM
lm_fit <- lm(log_Salary ~ NBA_DraftNumber +  Age + G + MP + TS.
              +WS, data = USA_players)

#Using Neyman PEarson Paradigm, I will take out TS even though it has a P Value of 0.06

```

```{r}
lm_fit <- lm(log_Salary ~ NBA_DraftNumber +  Age + G + MP
              +WS, data = USA_players) #Runs a linear model to determine the relationship between Salary Numeric and the possible predictors: Age, DraftNumber, Games, Minutes Played, and wins
summary(lm_fit)

#Run an anova instead?
anova(lm_fit)

```

The summary function shows that a player's draft number, age, games played, and minutes played are signficant predictors of of a player's salary. But I am a bit surprised that the data shows that if a player has a lower draft number or plays less games, then their salary will tend to be higher.


```{r}
plot(USA_players$Age, USA_players$log_Salary, col = "navy blue")
plot(USA_players$G, USA_players$log_Salary, col = "green")
plot(USA_players$MP, USA_players$log_Salary, col = "red")
plot(USA_players$WS, USA_players$log_Salary, col = "red")
```

```{r}
(obs_stat_Age <- cor(USA_players$Age, USA_players$log_Salary))
(obs_stat_G <- cor(USA_players$G, USA_players$log_Salary))
(obs_stat_MP <- cor(USA_players$MP, USA_players$log_Salary))
(obs_stat_WS <- cor(USA_players$WS, USA_players$log_Salary))
```
I did not include the scatterplots of these graphs because it would go above the page limit. However, when I ran the correlation between a player's salary and the statistically significant predictors, it shows that there could be a positive correlation between each of the predictor variables. 

I then ran a a one tailed permuation test to create a null distribution of the correlation between salary and the statistically significant predictor variables. I will only display the null distribution of the correalation between WS (win shares and salary) due to page limit restrictions but the other three null distributions will be in the appendix.

Every professional athelete's path to getting an NBA contract varies. After running hypothesis test, I noticed that highest range of salaries for professional atheletes are the ones that are signed using Bird Rights. Bird Rights, once again, is when a team is allowed to go beyond its salary cap to sign a player to its max contract.

Must Analyses, espcially where I tested for the difference in the means of multiple groups, it showed that the difference in the salaries per the way a player signed were statistically significant. Thus, it helped me recieve insight on the what is the best way to achieve economic success. My Analyses showed that you dont have to being an star coming out of high school to get paid. But  a player's loyalty to a team and vice versa play a factor. If a player stays on a team for a while, they are allegible to recieve a higher paid contract due to Bird rights. This showed to be true because the visualization of the data shows that Bird rights have a higher range and median of salaries.

One Issue I encountered with this project was converting string values to integers. For example, in the salary column of my data set, each data point contained a $ before hand, making it a string variable. This cause me to do research that can remove the dollar sign. However, even after I removed the dollar sign, the value was still a string variable, so I had to disvover a was to convert the data type into integers.

I was very glad with the visualization of my data. The boxplots showed a clear difference between the salaries between groups. This made me more comfortable when I ran steps 2-5 of my hypothesis test to show that the difference in the means between the two groups were statistically signficiant.
